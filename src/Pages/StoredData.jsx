The story shuttles between Vandiyathevan's travels in Chola country and the young Prince Arulmozhivarman's (later known as Raja Raja Chola) travels in Sri Lanka. The narrative deals with attempts by his sister Kundavai to bring back Arulmozhivarman to establish political peace in a land seemingly beset with unrest and civil war plotted by vassals and petty chieftains."

In the audio launch function, Rajini also revealed that Mani did not cast him in the movie in spite of him requesting a role for him to play.Mani who just gave a smile at that time has now revealed the real reason for not casting Rajinikanth in the movie. Mani said that 'If Rajinikanth had to be cast, the story has t be modified according to his star status. or I will receive backlash from his fans, If I do so I will be getting counterblast from Kalki fans.

            With the ability to get readings on the fly, people have the peace of mind to safely attend events, dine in restaurants, and do other activities.
            
            Portable enough to use easily in classrooms, theaters, and other places, the device will help increase safety measures in indoor settings.
            
            The ViraWarn Freedom also boasts 100 percent accurate readings of COVID-19.
            
            This has been verified by George Mason University, one of 21 21 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases certified labs. In fact, GMU is only one of the labs in the US that can aerosolize COVID-19 and test it.

            Life-like yet uncanny, the design of their robot, Ameca, was partially inspired by the grey, humanoid machines we see in pop culture such as movies like I, Robot.
            
            Indeed, in an interview with CNET, Ameca’s Director of Operations explained that they purposely designed the robot to look more like a robot than a human.
            
            Pictures don’t really do it justice; you need to see it in action for the full experience.
            
            From the wide deliberate motions of the arms to the human-like facial expressions to the subtle twitches of the eyes, you’ll be blown away by the smooth fluid motions.
            
            But don’t expect them to run and leap like Boston Dynamic’s robots anytime soon though.
            
            Currently, the Ameca is designed to be used to interact with people organically for customer service, information terminals, or even for entertainment.`

            If this sounds familiar, it’s because MAKO Design does a very similar thing using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) technologies. Before MAKO helps build a physical product, whether it’s via product prototyping or manufacturing, we build a digital replica of the product called the CAD to simulate how the product will function in real life.
            
            A digital twin, however, is built for full real-time simulation purposes.
            
            IBM provides a great example. A wind turbine equipped with sensors relays important data about energy output, temperature, weather conditions, and other data to the digital twin. What separates digital twins from other simulations is that users can run multiple simulations with great precision. In addition, this new data and insights from these simulations can be relayed back immediately back to the wind turbine.
            
            As you can imagine, this new technology invention opens up huge opportunities. Using digital twins, we can find improvements for both products and processes alike.`

            While the Body Scan looks like a typical scale it, in fact, comes with a retractable handle at the front to provide incredibly accurate body composition information.
            
            By using the handle, users can get accurate measurements of the fat and muscle mass of their torso, arms, and legs. And the Body Scan will also tell you if your readings are below or above average.
            
            In addition, users can get insights into their vascular age and cardiovascular health. The scale itself can also provide readings of small nerve activity in the feet.

            Currently in the prototyping phase, the purpose of the SkyDrive is to help transport yourself, others, or goods quickly and efficiently. It can take off, fly and land without a runway autonomously or with a pilot. And with a maximum load of 500 kg, flying altitude of 500 meters, and a speed of 100 km/h, there are an endless number of use cases for a flying vehicle of this size.
            
            From rapid emergency response to day-to-day deliveries, SkyDrive leverages airspace to get goods and people to their destinations faster than ever before.
            
            Plus think of the surge in popularity of ride-sharing apps and on-demand car rental services like Zipcar. SkyDrive is the next evolution of convenient and affordable travel.
            
            At CES 2022, SkyDrive showcased a prototype model, the SD-03, and how they intend to use the SkyDrive as an air taxi. Their goal is to have the next iteration, the SD-05, ready in time to do just that for the 2025 World Expo.`

The multiple Oscar-winner is bringing back the 2009 blockbuster movie, starring Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang, to the theatres for another run. According to Cameron, Avatar reminded the audience about their innate love for nature and the beauty around us. "I think people found a universal human experience that they could relate to. And there's one other thing, which is, when we were kids, we just innately loved nature, animals, we loved being out in nature. As our lives progress, we become more and more away from nature," Cameron said during a virtual press conference, also attended by PTI, on Monday night.
            He added, "And society at large anywhere in the world is suffering from nature deficit disorder of some kind. This movie puts us back into that childlike wonder about nature, about nature's grandeur and complexity and beauty."
            
            Set in the year 2154, Avatar explored how humans establish a colony on a fictional moon called Pandora, populated by lush green forests, huge beasts and its native community Na'vi.

            According to Variety, the 58-year-old actor is not seeking a career resurgence. Pitt feels like his long career in movies is coming to an end soon.
            
            "I consider myself on my last leg this last semester or trimester. What is this section gonna be? And how do I wanna design that?" said the Troy actor while giving an interview with the GQ magazine.
            
            Director Quentin Tarantino, known for his super-hit film 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' starring Pitt has admitted that if Pitt's final stages in his career actually arrive, then the Hollywood film industry would be losing 'one of the last remaining big-screen movie stars', reported Variety.
            
            Showering praises for the Oscar-winning actor, Tarantino said, "It's just a different breed of man. And frankly, I don't think you can describe exactly what that is because it's like describing star shine. I noticed it when we were doing 'Inglourious Basterds'...

In an update shared two days ago, Mila and Ashton revealed they were at $15 million, halfway to the goal. The funds raised will be donated to housing Ukrainian refugees, they said. Mila Kunis was born in Chernivitsi, southern Ukraine, in 1983 and moved to USA in 1991; "I have always considered myself an American, a proud American. ... But today, I have never been more proud to be a Ukrainian," she said in a video shared on Instagram. "I've never been more proud to be married to a Ukrainian," Ashton Kutcher added.

After leaving the dough (or atta) to rest overnight, parathas are made by cooking the dough on a tava before shallow frying. The most common way to eat parathas is to stuff them with a filling of your choosing. Parathas can be stuffed with any number of fillings, but some of our favourites are aloo paratha (stuffed with potatoes) and methi paratha (stuffed with fenugreek). `

Made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils and rice, these rice cakes are dangerously easy to eat. Since idli are pretty bland on their own, these mini pancake-like breakfast staples are served alongside sambar, coconut based chutneys, or spicy fish curries. Over the years, idli has evolved into many different varieties, so you’re sure to find one that satisfies your taste buds. `
